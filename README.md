This is the OpenRISC fork of the GNU binutils and gdb
[repository](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git). The
binutils part is already included in the upstream repository, but gdb
is only available for OpenRISC from this repository.

Development of the OpenRISC release is in the `or1k` branch. Changes
to the binutils part should go upstream as fast as possible, so that
only experimental features are tested here. The upstream development
is available in the branch `upstream` and it is merged regularly.
